      Remember that mail can take a lot longer than you may expect when shipping
      across borders. This is doubly true if you are sending during a holiday like christas.
      For this reason it's prudent to be early and send out your package sooner rather than later.

    <p>
      Good luck with your gifting! Sincerely, the creators of secret-santas.
